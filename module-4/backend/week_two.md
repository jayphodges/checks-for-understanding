1. What's one difference between ES5 and ES6?

ES6 has improved string interpolation.

2. What's the difference between asynchronous and synchronous JavaScript?

Synchronous runs in order that it is presented, while asynchronous can happen in any order.

3. What are the four pillars of Object Oriented programming?

Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.

4. What are some tools available in JavaScript to help you write object oriented code?

ES6 classes, constructors, and prototypes.

5. What are some key concepts to be aware of when refactoring your JavaScript?

Work towards code readability and reusability, keep your code DRY, and remove code smells.

6. What's a callback function and what are some reasons when we use/need callback functions?

A function that is passed into another function so that it will execute as part of that function after the rest of the function runs.

7. What are the different scopes of variables in Javascript? When would you want to define global variables?

There are global and local scopes available in JavaScript, although ES6 did introduce block level variables with `let`. You would define global variables when you want the variable to be accessible throughout the script.

8. What's the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?

`===` is a strict comparison, and in order to be true both values must be exactly the same. In the case of `==` JavaScript will attempt to convert both values to a similar format, such that `1 == '1'` is true.

9. Why do front end frameworks exist?

In order to make front end development easier and faster, such that you can get more done in less time.

10. Why do people say "HTTP is stateless"?

It is an API that follows the REST conventions by using the basic HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.

12. What are some main characteristics of a team following an agile workflow?
