## Week Four - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week.

Note: When you're done, submit a PR.

**1. What's your favorite project management tool?**

Waffle, due to it's simplicity and easy integration into Github.

**2. Why do we create staging environments?**

In order to ensure your code works prior to a final deployment onto full production.

**3. What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?**

What the purpose of the project/app is, how to install the app locally and remotely, it's authors, acknowledgements, and how to contribute to the project.

**4. What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?**

I would like to effectively implement the ability to tab through a page in a rational manner, as well as ensuring that objects on the page are correctly labeled for assisted reading.

**5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?**

SQL injection, cross site scripting, password vulnerabilities, and overly verbose error messages.

**6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?**

Because it ensures that your code always passes it's tests and you are not able to push questionable code into production.

**7. What are some pros/cons of using ReactJS as a frontend tool?**

It allows for more dynamic updates of the webpage with the virtual dom accelerating how quickly the browser can react to changes and is quicker to develop then pure JavaScript, but you do lose certain levels of granularity you are able to achieve with pure JavaScript.

#### Review  

**8. What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?**

Good messages between team members, pull requests being validated by at least 1 other person before being merged, and single feature/task pull requests.

**9. Describe each of the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming.**

**Inheritance:** The ability to inherit functions from a parent class, allowing you to re-use code.
**Encapsulation:** The ability to wrap your methods and data togther in order to hide irrelevant details.
**Abstraction:** The ability to expose essential features while hiding everything that isn't necessary for the user to have access to.
**Polymorphism:** The ability to re-use code with the same function name in various ways.

**10. What's a module in Ruby? What's the difference between a class and a module? What are some good use cases for modules?**

A module is a structure in Ruby that allows you to use methods across multiple classes, so it is similar to a superset of a class. They are useful if you want to share methods between classes without repeating the same code.
